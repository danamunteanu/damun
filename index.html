Being passionate about mathematics, I have dedicated my spare time to completing some Machine Learning courses in Python and am eager to apply this knowledge in the near future. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others to help them enhance their skills. In my leisure time I love hiking and dancing with my 2 little kids.</p>
